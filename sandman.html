      <p id = bginfo>
        The Sandman is a crimefighter modeled in the vein of Batman:
        A wealthy playboy by the name of Wesley Dodds who fights crime in an
        intimidating manner. Later down the line, Dodds would be reinvented
        as a more traditional superhero in spandex with his own kid sidekick.

    <h3 class = header> What are the selling points of this book?</h3>
      <p id = likes>
        Simon and Kirby's imagination and art are the highlights of this book.
        The art is eccentric and pops with dynamic action, and the plots carry
        that same eccentricity and ingenuity, with highlights like a villainous
        take on the Old Testament's Noah, the story of a boy who wants some long
        pants and gets entangled with a child-size mobster lookalike because of
        it, and the love story of an up=and-coming boxer trying to win both
        the title belt and the heart of the commentator.
