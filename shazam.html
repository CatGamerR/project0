    <h3 class = "header">Who is Shazam?</h3>
    <p id= bginfo>Shazam, known originally as Captain Marvel, was the creation of
      Bill Parker and C.C. Beck at the time Superheroes were the new hotness.
      A young boy by the name of Billy Batson was granted the capabilities of 6
      legendary figures, and could call upon them by speaking the magic word:
      SHAZAM! The magic word would call down a lightning bolt to strike Billy,
      and transform him into the adult superhero Captain Marvel!
      Powered by the Wisdom of Solomon, the Strength of Hercules,
      the Stamina of Atlas, the Power of Zeus, the Courage of Achilles, And
      the Speed of Mercury, Captain Marvel makes it his duty to fight evil
      wherever it may appear!</p>
    <h3 class = 'header'>What stories are collected in Volume 1?</h3>
    <p id = "colvol">
      Shazam Vol 1 collects issues 1-18 of DC's Shazam run, though issue 8,
      which is all Golden Age reprints, only has its cover included.

    <h3 class= "header">What are the selling points of this volume?</h3>
      <p id = "likes">
        First things first, C.C. Beck's cartoony and colorful artstyle captures
        the charm and whimsy inherent to the Captain's world. Speaking of which,
        the stories in this volume carry massive amounts of childlike wonder
        and imagination (imagine a kid that was so nice, everyone couldn't help
        but do nice things for him when they see him, or perhaps
        a group of aliens that steal all the candy on Earth, of all things, or
        even sentient vegetables from a salad planet!)
      </p>
    <h3 class = 'header'>What are the weak points of this volume?</h3>
      <p id = "dislikes">
        While the new characters have their own charm, I feel the original cast
        from the Golden Age is woefully underutilized. This is particularly
        egrigious with the villains: Dr. Sivana, Ibac, and Mister Mind all
        appear in this volume, but King Kull, Captain Nazi, and Black Adam don't
        even show up once. On the heroic side of the absence spectrum, Uncle
        Marvel makes a small cameo in issue 1 but doesn't get a role until
        issue 14. I also have a minor gripe with the art of the later issues,
        as it mixes the cartoony Beck style with more realistically drawn art.
      </p>
    <h3 class = 'header'>Would I recommend this book?</h3>
      <p id = 'recommend'>
        Yes. Even though I have some notable gripes about the 70s Shazam,
        I can wholeheartedly say that the charm and imagination of the Fabulous
        Forties Captain Marvel is alive and well in this Bronze Age revival.
