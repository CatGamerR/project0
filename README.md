# Project 0

My Project is a fansite that holds amateur reviews of my favorite comics. Each
html page has a corresponding stylesheet, except for cage.html, which uses
bootstrap. The comic page stylesheets have a header class, id tags for each
section of the review, before and after selectors, and a link selector that
provide the style for the page. The bootstrap sheet divides the cage page
into columns for each header and containers for each paragraph, with buttons
at the end. There is also a table on the main page that ranks the books
according to my preference.
