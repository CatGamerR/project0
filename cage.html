                        Luke Cage is a superhero with unbreakable skin that
                        does hero jobs for a price. Essentially a mercenary.

                        If you like Blaxploitation films, you'll like this. It's
                        also a collection of stories featuring an oft-overlooked
                        hero. The idea of a superhero for hire is used well
                        within the pages of these comics, with a few characters
                        pointing out the selfishness inherent to mercenary work,
                        and the character himself is a thrill.

                <div class = "col">What are some of the low points?</div>
                    <div class = "container">
                        The title character himself is a stereotypical
                        Angry Black Man, and one character in particular is
                        an exaggerated caricature of a big black woman with
                        thick red lips and a southern accent. Generally, the
                        flaws inherent in the Blaxploitation genre are present
                        in this blaxploitation comic.

                <div class = "col">Would I recommend this book?</div>
                    <div class = "container">
                        Despite the dated stereotypes presented by the hero,
                        I'd still say this book is worth a read for the premise.
                        If you can enjoy it by looking past the stereotypes,
                        it's a fine read. Give it a shot.
