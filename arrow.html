      <p id = bginfo>
        Green Arrow is a societal playboy by the name of Oliver Queen, whom I
        can best describe as a lighthearted version of Batman.

    <h3 class = header> What are the selling points of this book?</h3>
      <p id = likes>
        Seeing the origins of an obscure hero, plus a good laugh at the
        unoriginality sometimes. Also, the art is nice and colorful, which is a
        plus.
      </p>
    <h3 class = header> What are some of the weak points of this book?</h3>
      <p id = dislikes>
        There is a VERY dated stereotype of a Native American in one issue.
