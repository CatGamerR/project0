    <h3 class = header>Who is Superman?</h3>
      <p id = bginfo>
        Superman, if you somehow don't know the story of THE go-to guy when
        it comes to superheroes, is the sole survivor of the destroyed planet
        Krypton (Though that's not the case anymore). Adopted by a kindly couple
        in Smallville, Kansas, Superman discovers he is a superhuman under a
        yellow sun, and sets about using these great powers for Truth,
        Justice, and the American Way!

        This volume collects issues 1-31 of Action Comics, issues 1-7 of
        Superman, and issues 1-2 of New York World's Fair Comics.

    <h3 class = header>What are the selling points of this volume?</h3>
      <p id = likes>
        Quite possibly the biggest selling point this book has is its contents:
        The birth of an icon and his subsequent evolution. This is what I liked
        the most out of anything in the book: The ability to witness Superman's
        development as a concept and a character, from his beginnings as a
        rough-and-tumble hero who operated by his own rules to the paragon of
        Lawful Good that we know him to be today. There are also interesting
        little disrepancies, such as Clark Kent working for the Daily Star
        instead of the Daily Planet, and being found by a passing motorcyclist
        who hands him off to an orphanage where *then* he gets adopted, instead
        of the more familiar "rocket crashes near a farm, couple takes him in"
        that comic fans are familiar with today.
      </p>
    <h3 class = header>What are the weak points of this volume?</h3>
      <p id = dislikes>
        At the same time, the early installment weirdness that serves as the
        volume's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The cast
        of characters isn't very colorful, and Superman opts to face off against
        societal problems instead of, say, punching out supervillains. In
        addition, once Superman arrives, you can for the most part guarantee
        the ensuing battle against today's baddie will be skewed entirely
        in Superman's favor.
      </p>
    <h3 class = header>Would I recommend this book?</h3>
      <p id = recommend>
        I'd recommend this to comic book fans, but to the general public? I'd
        say you could pass this one up. The Superman in this book is decidedly
        NOT the Superman the general public is familiar with today, and most of
        his ensemble cast (by that I mean the supervillains) have yet to be
        introduced, creating a more down to earth Superman that rarely
        faces any real problems.
